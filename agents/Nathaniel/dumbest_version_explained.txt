This agent demonstrates basic principles of tramp shipping in a multi-agent environment:
1. Auction-based bidding: We place bids based on estimated costs.
2. Competitor modeling: We predict other agents’ costs (even if it’s a simple “correction factor”).
3. Greedy scheduling: We pick trades that appear profitable right now.
